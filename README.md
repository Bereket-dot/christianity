# First of all, I want you to understand that the web is only for information and there will be for other religions too. just started from Christianity :-)

"Sacred History" is an immersive, educational platform exploring the rich narratives of religious traditions through interactive timelines, key figures, and sacred texts. Designed for curious minds, it presents historical and theological information in an engaging, visually compelling format free from doctrine or bias.

Beginning with biblical history, the project will expand to include other world religions, offering the same depth of research and respectful presentation. Whether you're a student, historian, or simply intrigued by cultural heritage, this resource invites you to explore these stories as historical and literary traditions that have shaped civilizations.

Future expansions will cover Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and moreâ€”each treated with equal care and academic integrity. This is not about faith, but about understanding the profound narratives that continue to influence art, philosophy, and human identity across millennia.
